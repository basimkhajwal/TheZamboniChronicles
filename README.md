# TheZamboniChronicles
A javascript game made using the html5 canvas, still in development but comes with (hopefully) a useful underlying engine self-made ( that probably still has a lot of errors but never mind :P), the game idea is a simple 2d platformer, the full details are still under development but will hopefully come into shape soon and the game will progress from therein. 



######Current List Of Tasks To Do:
- Particle Effects (Add when needed)
- Physics Engine and collision detection
- MAKE COLLISION BETTER *sigh*
-

###The Game Ideas
The game still needs to be planned ..

##Current things to decide
- Should we stick with 20 x 20 tiles (50 tiles across and 30 up) like it is or make them bigger?
- How big should the player be?
- Will there be any puzzle / strategy involved or will it be a simple get-to-the-end type game?
- How will the player be scored (num coins collected, challenges done, time taken etc)?
- Will it be persistent (scores are saved for when you come back) or a one-time play?

- 2d platformer
- ~5 levels (10 is a bit far at the moment, we could improve later)
- single player
- moving platforms, not static game
- enemies
- level select map
- parallax scrolling
- shooting

######Tasks done:
- ADD ONBLUR AND ONFOCUS EVENT LISTENERS TO PREVENT PAUSE MOVEMENT - DONE
- Finish game states and managers - DONE
- Manage asset loading (images, sounds etc) - DONE
- Keyboard Input - DONE
- Mouse input - DONE
- Make a JSON level parser (Maybe leave it till later) - DONE (kind of cheating, already implemented by browser!)
- Make a 2d scene graph for GUI and base classes for rendering (Minimalistic at first, improve later) - DONE (basic stuff)
- Tile map manager - DONE (yaay! works with Tiled !!)
