###The Game Ideas
- 2d platformer
- ~10 levels
- single player
- moving platforms, not static game
- enemies
- level select map
- parallax scrolling
- shooting


###To decide
- graphics
- level design

###Stuff i'm unsure of
- are we having a plot of some kind?(i will write if there is)
- i would like to model some things
- is it going to be sidescrolling? ==> Probably not, will work easier if is set background, and level design would be easier.
    - I thought we could do, it won't be too difficult
