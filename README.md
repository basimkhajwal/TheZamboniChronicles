# TheZamboniChronicles
A javascript game made using the HTML5 canvas, still in development but comes with (hopefully) a useful underlying engine self-made ( that probably still has a lot of errors but never mind :P), the game idea is a simple 2d platformer, the full details are still under development but will hopefully come into shape soon and the game will progress from therein.

http://higherorderfun.com/blog/2012/05/20/the-guide-to-implementing-2d-platformers/

###Things for Cameron to make:
- Enemy, maybe a few types/different colours
- Signs for tutorial hints
- Pop up for tutorial hints, maybe text for them
- Moving platform
- Maybe lava
- Maybe more player designs to choose from


###The Game Ideas
The game still needs to be planned ..

###Possible Additions
- Lava that kills the player
- Water to swim in
- Enemies that move side to side
- Enemies that aim
- Moving platforms
- Balls that roll with rotations
- Gun for player
- Change player skin option
- More customisation option (customisation = good)
- Lighting, maybe a dark level where you get a torch or lantern
- Tutorial level, pop up hints, maybe with alert() that triggers in a certain place on the level

##Current things to decide
- Should we stick with 20 x 20 tiles (50 tiles across and 30 up) like it is or make them bigger?
- How big should the player be?
- Will there be any puzzle / strategy involved or will it be a simple get-to-the-end type game?
- How will the player be scored (num coins collected, challenges done, time taken etc)?
- Will it be persistent (scores are saved for when you come back) or a one-time play?
- 2d platformer
- ~5 levels (10 is a bit far at the moment, we could improve later)
- single player
- moving platforms, not static game
- enemies
- level select map
- parallax scrolling
- shooting
