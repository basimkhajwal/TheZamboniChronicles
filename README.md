# TheZamboniChronicles
A javascript game made using the HTML5 canvas, still in development but comes with (hopefully) a useful underlying engine self-made ( that probably still has a lot of errors but never mind :P), the game idea is a simple 2d platformer, the full details are still under development but will hopefully come into shape soon and the game will progress from therein.
